Planar Graphs

Ex:
5 nodes
6 edges
3 regions

For any planar graph:
nodes - edges + regions = 2


edges <= 3*nodes - 6 (if we have at least 3 edges) (for planar graphs)

This is not true for complete graphs, where every node has an edge to every other node.

#
# How many edges in a complete graph on n nodes? (n*(n-1))/2
# (quadratic)

def clique(n):
    # Return the number of edges
    # Try to use a mathematical formula...
    return (n*(n-1))/2

print clique(6)




HYPERCUBE GRAPHS

number of nodes needs to be a power of 2

every node is a bit pattern. only connect nodes that differ in 1 bit

nodes are n*log(n) edges (it's actually 0.5n*log(n), but in big theta we can ignore the 0.5)

in a hypercube every node has log(n) edges coming out of it (base 2) , so the degree of every node is log(n)
